The surprising answer few people will answer correctly is...

You should change doors. The odds of selecting the door with the Grand Prize is not equal between the two remaining doors.

Although the explanation for this can be found elsewhere, this is why in my own words.

When you originally select one of the three doors, the odds of correctly choosing a door is 1/3. The odds of selecting an incorrect door is 2/3.

But, after a door is opened revealing it does not have a Grand Prize, it's not a random event but is because there is foreknowledge that it's not hiding the Grand Prize. This is an important distinction with ramifications.

After the door has been opened revealing it isn't hiding the Grand Prize, let's re-evaluate what is now known...

Nothing has really changed that effects whether the original door you chose is hiding the Grand Prize. It's still 1/3 a winner, and 2/3 a loser.

But, something has changed regarding the two remaining doors... It has been revealed that one of those two doors is not hiding the Grand Prize, so now the "other" still closed door (which you didn't originally choose) is now a 50/50 proposition. 

In summary...
Door you originally chose = 33% chance a winner
Door that has been opened which doesn't hide the Grand Prize = 0% chance a winner
Door that is still closed which you didn't choose = 50% a winner

So, given the above, which door would you choose?
This statistical problem says that you should <change> your door which has approx a 66% chance of success because your original choice still has only a 33% chance of success.

Weird, but true.
